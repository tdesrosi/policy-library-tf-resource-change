This directory should contain the constraint .yaml files used in your environment. Unfortunately, there is no library for terraform resource change policies available that I know of. You can use the samples in this repository, which are located in the samples folder. If you would like to contribute samples, please file a pull request with new samples, or file an issue and I will look into it.
